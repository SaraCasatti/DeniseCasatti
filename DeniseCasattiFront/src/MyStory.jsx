                Professional Autobiography

I’ve been working to overcome the barriers that separate the general public from the mathematical sciences since 2013, when I began working as a Communications Analyst at the University of São Paulo (USP). Participating in the Knight Science Journalism Fellowship Program will enable me to achieve a central professional goal: writing a book about the challenges of crafting narratives about the mathematical sciences for a general audience.

As the coordinator of the journalism and social media team at the Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science (ICMC/USP), I have the opportunity to work as a science writer and publish reports on the mathematical sciences and related fields, such as computer science. In 2018, I received third place in the mathematics category of the IMPA-SBM Prize for Math and Science Journalism for the special report series “Mathematics is in Everything”.

I also created “Mathematics on the Psychoanalytic Couch”, a program and podcast selected in two public calls (in 2023 and 2024) by the educational radio station of the Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar), where I completed my Ph.D. in Psychology.

Additionally, I have extensive experience writing long-form nonfiction, including multiple book projects. At the end of my undergraduate studies in 2000, I wrote a book about the life story of a former prisoner. Later, I co-authored a book about the history of the traditional São Paulo neighborhood (Mooca). In 2022, I published A Singular and Plural Institute: The Five Decades of the ICMC, which interweaves ten literary narratives about pivotal moments in the institution's history with ten journalistic profiles.

As a fellow, I will have the opportunity to engage with experts in mathematics and science communication at MIT and other U.S. institutions. This experience will deepen my understanding of the barriers to communicating mathematics to the public and improve my skills as a science writer. Afterward, I will write the book I’ve been dreaming of.

Across my 12 years at USP, I have striven to make the technical and scientific language of mathematics more accessible and appealing to non-specialists. A distinguishing feature of my reporting is my use of literary techniques to narrate reality. In fact, while pursuing my master's degree in 2004, I participated in the Nieman Seminar for Narrative Editors at Harvard University in the United States, promoted by the Nieman Foundation.

In 2023, I spent two months as a visiting researcher in the Communications Division at Imperial College London. During that time, I conducted 15 interviews with researchers and communicators from institutions across the United Kingdom. My interviewees included Martin Hairer, winner of the 2014 Fields Medal and a professor at Imperial College London, and Ian Stewart, a professor emeritus at the University of Warwick and a world-renowned popularizer of mathematics. 

As in 2023 and 2004, I now need to expand my horizons and immerse myself in a collaborative environment to elevate my work and deliver my next book project. I am confident that the Knight Science Journalism Fellowship Program will provide that opportunity.
